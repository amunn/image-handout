# The `image-handout` package

The  `image-handout`  allows you to quickly generate a handout from 
 a sequentially numbered set of screen shot images.

It provides a setup command `\SetupHandout` and a single command to insert a set of images `\insertimages`.

Images are expected to be sequentially numbered with a common image prefix, example: `MyPrefix1.png`, `MyPrefix2.png` etc.  Leading zeros should be avoided. 

How you create the images is up to you, but for Mac users, a couple of simple apps are provided to choose a folder to save screenshots and rename a set of screen shot files.
